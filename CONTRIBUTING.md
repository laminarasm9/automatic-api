# How to edit the list

`README.md` is automatically generated from `README.md.template` and the data in [`data/`](./data/). Do not edit `README.md` directly. To update a project's information, edit the corresponding file in `data/`. To add a project, create a new file.

# What projects to submit

To qualify as "automatic" for our purposes, a piece of software must be a server that requires a small amount of configuration to set up, not a Web framework for building APIs, a code generator that leaves maintaining the code to its user, or a boilerplate. It should respond to changes to the database schema with no or minimal user intervention (like a restart or a SIGHUP). A submitted project must be at least alpha quality, i.e., ready for users to test. A project that is no longer actively maintained must be more mature than that and already tested by users.

Please only submit software you can run on your own servers.
