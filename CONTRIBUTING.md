# How to edit the list

`README.md` is automatically generated from `README.md.template` and the data in [`data/`](./data/). Do not edit `README.md` directly. To update a project's information, edit the corresponding file in `data/`. To add a project, create a new file.

# What projects to submit

To qualify as "automatic" for our purposes, a piece of software that exposes the API must take a minimal amount of configuration to set up, for example, just the credentials to access the database and a port on which to serve the API. It must not require the user to define schemas/models or API endpoints to get started. It should respond to changes to the database schema with no or minimal user intervention (e.g., a restart or a SIGHUP). This means that most Web frameworks, code generators, and boilerplates don't qualify.

A submitted project must be at least alpha quality, that is, ready for users to test. A project that is no longer actively maintained must be more mature than that and already tested by users.

Please only submit software you can run on your own servers.
